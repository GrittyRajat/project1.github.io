          <p>
            <b>Ratan Tata</b>, in full Ratan Naval Tata, (born December 28,
            1937, Bombay [now Mumbai], India),Ratan Tata hails from the famous
            Tata family, which got recognition under the guidance of his
            great-grandfather Jamsetji Tata, who later founded the Tata Group.
            He is an alumnus of the Cornell University College of Architecture
            and Harvard Business School through the Advanced Management Program
            that he completed in 1975. Ratan Tata joined his company in 1961
            when he used to work on the shop floor of Tata Steel, and was the
            apparent successor to J. R. D. Tata upon the latter’s retirement in
            19.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ratan Tata’s arrival coincided with the liberalization of Indian
            economics. The stage was set, also the lieutenant was ready to take
            the charge. With his relentless efforts, a young Ratan Tata got Tata
            Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and
            Tata Steel to acquire Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a
            largely India-centrist group into a global business.
